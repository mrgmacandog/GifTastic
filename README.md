## Future Improvements

1. Add ability to store favorite gifs into local storage so that when a user exits the browser and returns they will be able to see their favorite gifs.
2. Keep track of the gifs UID so that when a gif is favorited, the gif that it is associated will know that favorites status (Either currently in the favorites section and has a yellow star or not in the favorites section and has a hollow star).
3. Add a download button that will donwload the gif to the user's machine.
